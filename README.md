Codemanship TDD intensive course
================================

  what is tdd

  simple iterative process 3 key steps

   * write a failing test - this is your specification - it is here to define what the product should do, not whether it's working - that's a side benefit
  * write a code to pass the test as quickly as possible because we always want working code - too far into the red light and you have pain and unshippable code 
 * refactor to remove duplication mainly, and other code smells too

do this in a micro-iteration
keep going until you can't think of any more failing tests
